    <p>
    Misheyakir (literally "when you recognize") is the time when a
    person can distinguish between blue and white. The Gemara (ברכות ט)
    explains that when a person can distinguish between the blue
    (techelet) and white strings of their tzitzit, that is the earliest
    time a person can put on their talit and tefilin for Shacharit.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is also the earliest time one can say Shema L'chatchila
    (optimally).
    </p>
    <p>
    This time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to
    the GR\"A) after Alot HaShachar (Dawn).
    </p>
    <p>
    Note: This time is only for people who need to go to work or leave
    early in the morning to travel. However, normally a person should
    put on his talit/tefilin 60 regular minutes (and in the winter 50
    regular minutes) before sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out
    how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees
    (16.1) before sunrise on an equal day with sunrise and sunset set
    around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them
    zmaniyot according to the GR\"A, and we subtract 5/6 of that time
    from sunrise to get the time for Misheyakir. This is according to
    the Halacha Berurah, and this should only be done outside of Israel
    in more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do
    this because it is more according to the nature of the world.
    However, it does not seem like Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the
    Yalkut Yosef agrees with this opinion. Elevation is not included in
    Luach Amudei Horaah mode.

    <p>This is the time that the fast/taanit ends.</p>
    <p>
    This time is calculated as 20 regular minutes after sunset
    (elevation included).
    </p>
    <p>
    It is brought down in Halacha Berurah that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL
    was once traveling in New York and he said to his son, Rabbi David
    Yosef Shlita, that the fast ends 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset.
    However, in his sefer Chazon Ovadiah, he writes that the fast ends
    20 minutes after sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the Ohr HaChaim calendar, they write that the fast ends at Tzait
    Hacochavim. I asked Rabbi Benizri if this meant that the fast ends
    at 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset and he said, "Not necessarily,
    a person can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset if he wants to
    be stringent." I then asked him if those 20 minutes are zmaniyot
    minutes or regular minutes and he said, "Regular minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
    If a person wants to end the fast at 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after
    sunset, he has the right to do so. However, if a person wants to be
    stringent, he can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset.

    Tzeit/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after
    Bein Hashmashot/twilight finishes.
    </p>
    <p>
    This time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset
    (elevation included). According to Rabbeinu Tam, these 72 minutes
    are made up of 2 parts. The first part is 58 and a half minutes
    until the second sunset (see Pesachim 94a and Tosafot there). After
    the second sunset, there are an additional 13.5 minutes until
    Tzeit/Nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
    The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time
    between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into
    12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get
    a zmaniyot/seasonal minute in order to calculate 72 minutes. Another
    way of calculating this time is by calculating how many minutes are
    between sunrise and sunset. Take that number and divide it by 10,
    and then add the result to sunset. The app uses the first method.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out
    how many minutes are between sunset and 72 minutes as degrees (16.0)
    after sunset on an equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12
    hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot
    according to the GR\"A, and we add that time to sunset to get the
    time for Rabbeinu Tam. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and
    should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern
    areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do this because it is more
    according to the nature of the world; however, it does not seem like
    Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the Yalkut Yosef agrees with this

    <p>
    It should be noted that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L was of the opinion
    to keep the zmaniyot zman of Rabbeinu Tam whether or not it fell out
    before or after 72 regular minutes after sunset. However, in Luach
    Amudei Horaah mode, we use the lesser of the two times.
